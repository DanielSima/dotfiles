# Dotfiles

This repository contains various configuration files for common programs like bash or nano.
There are also more specific files for programs like Home Assistant, Plex and others.
Last but not least, there are setup scripts. Those are supposed to be run on new installations to setup basic things like packages or directiories.

All files are in branches named after OS or device like [Debian](/../../tree/debian) or [Raspberry pi 1](/../../tree/raspberry_pi_1).
